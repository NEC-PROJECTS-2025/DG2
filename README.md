### INTRODUCTION
NER identifies and classifies entities (e.g., names of people, organizations, locations) in text.Essential for NLP tasks like information extraction, machine translation, and question answering.Low-resource languages like Bodo lack sufficient annotated data and linguistic tools.Enhance entity recognition in underrepresented languages by overcoming data scarcity issues.
