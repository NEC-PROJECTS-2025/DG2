        <h2>🌟 About NER App</h2>
        <p>Welcome to the NER App, where cutting-edge technology meets the art of language! Our application harnesses the power of machine learning to perform Named Entity Recognition (NER) on your text, transforming the way you interact with information.</p>
        
        <h3>🎯 Our Mission</h3>
        <p>At NER App, we strive to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Empower users with advanced tools for extracting meaningful insights from text.</li>
            <li>Enhance the understanding of various languages, including low-resource languages like Bodo.</li>
            <li>Facilitate seamless information extraction, machine translation, and question-answering systems.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>🔍 How It Works</h3>
        <p>Our app employs state-of-the-art deep learning techniques, utilizing models such as:</p>

            <div class="grid-item">
                <h4>🌀 Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)</h4>
                <p>Efficient in capturing local patterns in the data, particularly useful for morphologically rich languages.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="grid-item">
                <h4>🔗 Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)</h4>
                <p>Known for their capability to learn long-term dependencies, ideal for sequence data tasks.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="grid-item">
                <h4>🔄 Gated Recurrent Units (GRU)</h4>
                <p>A simpler, faster alternative to LSTMs, effective for sequence prediction tasks.</p>
